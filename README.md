- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a complete asset. No one can learn everything, I know! In fact, the deeper I dive into the world of Software development
- The more I am convined in how huge it is and how far Humans have gotten over the years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Python, Jave, and JaveScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (not yet actually! I don't think am good enough to work on any big project with anyone!)
